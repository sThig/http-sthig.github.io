It's taken months to get to this point but Beta version one is now a thing!  I've added in a bug alert to let people know I'm beta testing, I've gone through a few writing edits (and will be hiring a copywriter) and I'll be bringing in the artwork relevant to the site just as soon as I draw it (my next big thing on my list)

Very excited to see this finally becoming a thing!
