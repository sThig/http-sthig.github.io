That's apparently the magic amount of time to keep a user's attention and increase productivity.

When building an app or feature in software, if you muddle it down with a zillion steps, bloated javascript and heavy load times then the user is going to be disengaged quickly (I've seen it many times when watching a user during an A/B testing session).

This is one reason video games are so addictive and hook people quickly because the response time to your next action is under 400 ms.

Making things simple, keeping things neat and fast will insure a better experience for the user.  [Don't make them think](https://www.amazon.com/)
