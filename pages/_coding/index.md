One of the biggest challenge of a designer is code, this is why I’ve spent years immersing myself with front end development (HTML, CSS, JS). I love nothing more than to take a design comp and actually code it. I enjoy building with [Bootstrap’s framework](https://getbootstrap.com/) and coding from the ground up. Being immersed in a team that uses Agile, GitHub and Atom to deploy code, I’m very comfortable in a tech environment.

Javascript is extremely challenging for me hence why I try to stay immersed in it weekly doing learning it's language to make my designs come to life.

My favorite flavors of code are HAML, SASS (scss), ES6 and ReactJS.  I enjoy the challenge code presents and try to improve in it daily.  Below are some articles and code samples I've done.
