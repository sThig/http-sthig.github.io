In 1994 I spent around 3 hours loading little floppy discs up in my very tiny macintosh to finally experience some software called "Photoshop".  After inserting the last disc, my computer crashed and I spent another half day trying to get it installed.  

For the past 20 years I've been immersed in Adobe's Photoshop and Illustrator.  As technology progressed, so have I using apps like Sketch, After Effects, Premier, Final Cut Pro, Keynote, Flash (yes, Flash... it just won't die) and Balsamiq for prototyping.

I love market research and it's something that gives me a lot of energy to get behind a project.  When behind a project I love to communicate that to the stakeholders with convincing excitement.  I can see color patterns in my head and if I've had enough coffee, I can hear all the colors too!  I keep up on the latest trends in web design (both with visual and front end coding trends) and in the end, I'm very concerned with the user's experience.
