Recently at work we had dialogue about how the elements on part of software should flow. For days we went back and forth on how it should look.  That's when I went to the [Laws of UX](https://lawsofux.com/) and read up on the [Law of Proximity](https://lawsofux.com/law-of-proximity) which states:

>Objects that are near, or proximate to each other, tend to be grouped together.

This law is useful because it gives the user a chance to view a lot of information as different clusters at a glance instead of a lot all at once thus overwhelming and possibly skipping important information.

>The principles of grouping (or Gestalt laws of grouping) are a set of principles in psychology, first proposed by Gestalt psychologists to account for the observation that humans naturally perceive objects as organized patterns and objects, a principle known as Pr√§gnanz. Gestalt psychologists argued that these principles exist because the mind has an innate disposition to perceive patterns in the stimulus based on certain rules. These principles are organized into five categories: Proximity, Similarity, Continuity, Closure, and Connectedness
