Hello there,

I want to take a moment and thank you for inquiring about my services for commissions or paid work. During the next few years I am focusing on several personal projects that will make it preventative to take on anything new.

FAQ
Find a specific answer to your inquiry below:

- **Will you draw my project (or me) for free?** No.
- **I want something simple, it wouldn't take you five minutes.** It's never simple, it takes longer than you think
- **I'd like to hire you, If I can afford you.** Don't make me think, make an offer (also, see above, I'm not taking commissions)
- **I have an idea for this children's book, would you illustrate it? When it gets published I'll pay you.** Ok J.K. Rowling, focus on your book first, get it accepted by an agent, then a publisher then tell that publisher you want to hire me as an illustrator.
- **Please draw my project (or me) for free. I'll give you credit** Credit doesn't put gas in my car or feed me.
- **Will you build me a website?** No, it's time consuming and expensive to maintain. I suggest using a DIY website builder such as Wix or Squarespace.
