One of the biggest challenge for a designer is code. This is why I’ve spent years immersing myself in front end-development (HTML, CSS, JS). I love nothing more than to take a design comp and actually code it. I enjoy building with [Bootstrap’s framework](https://getbootstrap.com/) and coding from the ground up. Being immersed in a team that uses Agile, GitHub and Atom to deploy code, I’m very comfortable in a tech environment.

Because Javascript is extremely challenging, I try to stay immersed in it, becoming fluent in it's language in order to make my designs come to life.

My favorite flavors of code are HAML, SASS (SCSS), ES6 and ReactJS. I enjoy the challenge that code presents and try to improve in it daily. Below are some articles and code samples I've done.
