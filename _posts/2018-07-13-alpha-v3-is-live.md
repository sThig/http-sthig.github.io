A lot of refactoring in the CSS, more organized and now just a few things left on the list

* Write out some concise paragraphs for each section
* Build an archive
* Get users to test the site
* Update the About section with examples
* Create relavent illustrations for each section
* Add in art mov files into the illustration section

I'm really excited to see this finally coming together.  It's been a long and difficult grind to get to this point but I'm super happy with the progress.
