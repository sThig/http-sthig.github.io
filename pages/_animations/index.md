When I was a kid I saw Disney’s The Jungle Book and remember thinking “This is what I want to be in life, an animator.” After college I spent months creating an animation portfolio that I sent out to every animation firm in the world (at the time, around 30) and was rejected by everyone. I was crushed but it never crushed my spirit.

After I started my illustration freelance career working with clients like McGraw-Hill and The Wall Street Journal, I got a phone call one day from DreamWorks saying they needed some extra help for a project called Shrek, and I got to be part of the team. My childhood dream was realized.

I use both After Effects and hand drawn frames to create my illustrations. It’s an extremely timely process but a fun one.
