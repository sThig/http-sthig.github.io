excerpt: humans naturally perceive objects as organized patterns and objects, a principle known as Prägnanz
---

If there is one thing I abide by more than anything else, it's groups of elements within an app.  So many times I've loaded up apps to have elements all over the place leaving me frustrated, having to think and ultimately I uninstall the app.

When elements are grouped together, a user feels much more at ease to navigate through an app.  

> Elements tend to be perceived into groups if they are sharing an area with a clearly defined boundary.

### Principles of Grouping

> The principles of grouping (or Gestalt laws of grouping) are a set of principles in psychology, first proposed by Gestalt psychologists to account for the observation that humans naturally perceive objects as organized patterns and objects, a principle known as Prägnanz. Gestalt psychologists argued that these principles exist because the mind has an innate disposition to perceive patterns in the stimulus based on certain rules. These principles are organized into five categories: Proximity, Similarity, Continuity, Closure, and Connectedness.[1][2][3][4]

One of my favorite sites to visit is [Laws Of UX ](https://lawsofux.com/) and they present these laws in a nicely formatted way.
