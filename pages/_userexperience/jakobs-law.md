[Dr. Jakob Nielson](https://www.nngroup.com/people/jakob-nielsen/), a User Advocate at Apple Computers talked about how users spend most of their time on other sites ( I mean seriously, how many times have you been to my site here as say compared to...Facebook?).

>Users spend most of their time on other sites. This means that users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know.

This means that users prefer your site to work the same way all other sites they already know ([referenece](https://www.nngroup.com/videos/jakobs-law-internet-ux/)).  Therefore why punish a user by making a site completely different than Facebook, Twitter, Instagram?  I'm not saying make a complete carbon copy of the big social media networks, however having a standard **like** button and a way to comment that is familiar or a notification system that users are used to means more time engaged on your site (and less frustration).

When I begin to look at the user experience of a new feature in software or an app, I look at current trends and how they are being implemented.  I like to look at A/B testing to see what users are having a better experience instead of seeing them frustrated or trying to find a button to "*do the thing.*"

Don't punish your users by reinvinting the wheel.  There's no need to provide a carbon copy of something, and of course be original but do know a user is going to compare your app to an app they already use.
