    <p>I have been in the creative industry for over 20 years. Currently I work as a front end developer and user interface designer for ProctorU in Birmingham creating apps using a few flavors of HTML (HTML5, HAML), CSS (as well as SASS ðŸ’…) and pure vanilla Javascript with a little dab of React.js.</p>
<p>
    I enjoy coding on top of Bootstrap and have been proudly help develop our own CSS Framework at ProctorU called Hootstrap. </p>

    <p>In the past Iâ€™ve been an illustrator for the Wall Street Journal, aboutated for Dreamworks and worked with dozens of ad firms, book companies and mega large companies (such as McGraw Hill, Coca Cola and Toyota).</p>
    <p> I live and die by two week sprints in an Agile environment and work with a great team of developers.<p>
    <p>
    Iâ€™ve given a TedX Talk, published a book, shown artwork in various galleries, am an Eagle Scout, an INFJ given lectures at various universities, lived in abroad, like techy gadgets and photography.
    Iâ€™ve ridden my mountain bike from Canada to Mexico in the hardest race in the world, the Tour Divide (note, not like that wimpy-pimply race, the Tour De France.
    I also enjoy photography and I play well with others.</p>
