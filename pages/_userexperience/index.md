Starting with ideas on cocktail napkins then moving to full blown wireframes designed in [Balsmiq](https://balsamiq.com/), I own the entire design process with the user in mind at all times.

Diving into A/B testing, looking for interesting trends in data, having a huge amount of empathy for the user’s experience gives me so much energy and I find myself almost obsessed with a project.

For over two decades I’ve been in some form of creative role where the end user was in mind. Within the past decade I made the transition to a tech environment where I taught web design at UAB and now am a UiUX designer at ProctorU where we live and die by two week sprints in an Agile environment.

I am well versed in design, illustration, front end development (HTML, CSS, JS) and I play well with others.

_*** Due to the fact that my user experience portfolio is work related, I cannot show any projects.  Please enjoy these articles written by me instead._
