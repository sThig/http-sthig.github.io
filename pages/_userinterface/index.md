As a designer and developer, I spend hours coming up with pixel perfect user interfaces for web apps and software. I meticulously layout things down to the last pixel so no client or developer can tell if it's a graphic or a website. User interfaces (UI) should look good and make sense to a developer. When designing an app I not only think of what a beautiful ui would look like-but how it would make a great user experience as well.
