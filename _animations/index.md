When I was a kid I saw Disney’s Jungle Book and remember thinking “This is what I want to be in life, an Animator.” After college I spent months creating several portfolios that I sent out to every animation house in the world (at the time, around 30) and was rejected by everyone. I was crushed but it never crushed my spirit.
When I startd my animation career I got a phone call one day from Dreamworks saying they needed an extra animator for a project called “Shrek” and I got to be part of the team. My childhood dream was realized.
I use both After Effects and hand drawn frames to create my illustrations. It’s an extremely timely procress but a fun one.
