I have been in the creative industry for over 20 years. Currently I work as a front end developer and user interface designer for [ProctorU](https://www.proctoru.com/).

I enjoy coding on top of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/) and have been proudly help develop our own CSS Framework at work called [Hootstrap](https://proctoru.github.io/hootstrap/). In the past I've been an illustrator for the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/), animated for [Dreamworks](http://www.dreamworksanimation.com/) and worked with dozens of ad firms, book companies and mega large companies (such as [McGraw Hill](https://www.mheducation.com/), [Coca Cola](https://us.coca-cola.com/) and [Toyota](https://www.toyota.com/)). I live and die by two week sprints in an [Agile](https://serraview.com/what-does-the-agile-work-environment-look-like/) environment and work with a great team of developers.

I've given a [TedX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LI1JnKKehU) Talk, published a hi hi hi hi [book](https://www.amazon.com/Trail-Magic-Art-Soft-Pedaling-ebook/dp/B00NJQZ6GK), shown artwork in [various galleries](https://nakedartusa.com/pages/scott-thigpen), am an [Eagle Scout](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle_Scout_(Boy_Scouts_of_America)>), an [INFJ](https://www.16personalities.com/infj-personality) given lectures at various universities, lived in abroad, like techy gadgets and photography.

I've ridden my mountain bike from Canada to Mexico in the hardest race in the world, [the Tour Divide](http://b-metro.com/the-adventurers-ride-the-divide/14562/) (note, not like that wimpy race, the [Tour De France](https://www.letour.fr/en/).

I also enjoy photography, love my dog and I play well with others.
