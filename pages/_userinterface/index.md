As a designer and developer, I spend hours coming up with pixel perfect user interfaces for web apps and software.  I meticulously layout things down to the last pixel so no client or developer can tell if it's a graphic or a website.  User interfaces (ui) should look good and make sense to a developer. Not only that, when designing an app I not only think of what a beautiful ui would look like, but how it'd make a great user experience as well.
