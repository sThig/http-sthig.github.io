One of the biggest challenge of a designer is code, this is why I've spent years immersing myself with front end code (HTML, CSS, JS).  I love nothing more than to take a design comp and then convert it over to an actual website.  I enjoy building with Bootstrap's framework and coding from the ground up.  Being immersed in a team that uses Agile, GitHub and Atom to deploy code, I'm no stranger to this either.

When I'm done making pixel perfect ui/ux wireframes and comps, I code those visual elements to go on the web.  I also review old code, technical debt and convert it into current code to keep a website fresh.  

My favorite flavors of code are HAML, SASS (scss), ES6 and ReactJS.
