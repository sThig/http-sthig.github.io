In the 90s I got my first illustration project which was to illustrate a flyer for a frat party. It was my first illustration project that got me hooked which led to bigger clients like BBVA/Compass bank, The Wall Street Journal, Dreamworks, Coca Cola, Snapple and Toyota to name a few.

For over 20 years I illustrated for companies across the world and down to the hometown repair shop. The tools I used were always Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. In fact I know Illustrator so well that I rarely even use a sketch to work off of now-a-days.

I won an award

Recently I’ve abandoned Illustrator for Affinity’s Designer and Photo (I did this because I think Adobe’s subscription based model is a rip-off and honestly Affinity is better).
