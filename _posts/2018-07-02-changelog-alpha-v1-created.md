A few red-eyed days of coding trying to make the push to get this site up.  I'm happy how things have gone and delighted to see this site finally coming together.  A few tasks I have to still do which are to pay someone to help me write (because I suck at it terribly) and shore up some of the code.  

After that are all the spot illustrations and then I can finally deploy to GitHub Pages.
