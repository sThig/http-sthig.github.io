400 Milliseconds.  That's apparently the magic amount of time to keep a user's attention and increase productivity.

When building an app or feature in software, if you muddle it down with a zillion steps, bloated javascript and heavy load times then the user is going to be disengaged quickly (I've seen it many times when watching a user during an A/B testing session).  Think about it, while you were reading this very brief article I wrote, your phone, watch, computer, chat app, calendar and text messenger has probably beeped at you begging for you to tear your eyes away (I mean, it has for me just writing this).

This is one reason video games are so addictive and hook people quickly because the response time to your next action is under 400 ms.

Making things simple, keeping things neat and fast will insure a better experience for the user.
