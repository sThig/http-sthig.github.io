Starting with ideas on cocktail napkins, to drying out markers on the whiteboard to full blown wireframes designed in  [Balsmiq](https://balsamiq.com/), I own the entire design process with the user in mind at all times.  

Diving into A/B testing, looking for interesting trends in data, having a huge amount of empathy for the user's experience gives me so much energy and I find myself almost obsessed with a project's initial start.

When I'm energetic about a project, I become an evangelist for it and can sell ice to eskimos (or stakeholders, developers or a design team).

For over two decades I've been in some form of creative role where the end user was in mind.  Within the past decade I made the transition to a tech environment where I taught web design at [UAB](https://uab.edu/) and at ProctorU where as a team, we implement the Agile way of creating products.

I am well versed in design, illustration, front end development (HTML, CSS, JS) and I play well with others.
