In the 90s I got my first illustration project creating a flyer for a frat party. More than two decades later and I've work with clients including McGraw Hill, BBVA/Compass bank, The Wall Street Journal, DreamWorks, Coca-Cola, Snapple and Toyota. I even won an award once for an editorial piece.

My tool of choice to has always been [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/) and, until a few years ago, I used it religiously I have recently switched to [Affinity](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/) and [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) (in my opinion the apps are far superior to the Adobe Suite).

While most of my recent illustrations are SVG intended for web apps I still show work in galleries as well as take on commissions (on a case by case basis).
